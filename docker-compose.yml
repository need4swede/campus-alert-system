# Usage:
# For development:
#   BUILD_MODE=development PORT=8080 docker-compose up
# For production:
#   BUILD_MODE=production PORT=80 docker-compose up
# Or use default (production):
#   docker-compose up

## Usage:

### Building Locally:

# __Development Mode:__

# ```bash
# BUILD_MODE=development PORT=8080 docker-compose -f docker-compose.build.yml up --build
# ```

# __Production Mode:__

# ```bash
# BUILD_MODE=production PORT=80 docker-compose -f docker-compose.build.yml up --build
# ```

# ### Using Pre-built Images:

# __Development Mode:__

# ```bash
# BUILD_MODE=development PORT=8080 docker-compose up
# ```

# __Production Mode:__

# ```bash
# BUILD_MODE=production PORT=80 docker-compose up
# ```

# The setup automatically handles the authentication differences between environments:

# - Development: Uses local authentication with mock users
# - Production: Uses Microsoft OAuth

# Before deploying to production, make sure to update the `.env.production` file with your actual Microsoft OAuth credentials.
