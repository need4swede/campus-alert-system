# Campus Alert System - iOS Companion App Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for implementing an iOS companion app for the Campus Alert System, with push notification support and multi-tenant containerization for different school districts.

## Documentation Overview

This documentation suite consists of the following files:

1. **[iOS Companion App Plan](ios-companion-app-plan.md)**: High-level overview and implementation plan for the iOS companion app and required backend changes.

2. **[iOS App Technical Specification](ios-app-technical-spec.md)**: Detailed technical specifications for the iOS app and backend services, including API endpoints, database schema, and authentication flows.

3. **[iOS App Structure](ios-app-structure.md)**: Recommended project structure for the iOS app, including directory organization and code snippets for essential components.

4. **[Multi-Tenant Containerization](multi-tenant-containerization.md)**: Detailed approach for implementing a multi-tenant containerization solution that allows different school districts to run the app in containers and link to their organization from mobile devices.

## Key Features

### iOS Companion App

- **Push Notifications**: Real-time alerts delivered via Apple Push Notification service (APNs)
- **Offline Support**: Cache critical data for offline access
- **Role-Based Access**: Different interfaces and permissions for users, admins, and super-admins
- **Microsoft OAuth Integration**: Secure authentication using existing school credentials
- **Organization Linking**: QR code and deep link support for connecting to specific school districts

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

- **Isolated Deployment**: Each school district gets its own isolated container environment
- **Customization**: Organization-specific branding, settings, and configurations
- **Mobile Integration**: Simple linking between mobile devices and specific organization instances
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling based on each organization's needs
- **Security**: Data isolation between different school districts

## Implementation Roadmap

The implementation is divided into four phases:

1. **Phase 1: Backend Enhancement** (Weeks 1-6)
   - Develop the API server with authentication and alert management
   - Implement the database schema with multi-tenancy support
   - Set up the containerization for the enhanced backend

2. **Phase 2: Push Notification Service** (Weeks 7-10)
   - Implement the APNs integration
   - Create the notification dispatcher
   - Test the notification delivery and handling

3. **Phase 3: iOS App Development** (Weeks 11-18)
   - Develop the core application functionality
   - Implement authentication and organization linking
   - Add push notification handling and offline support

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Deployment** (Weeks 19-24)
   - Conduct internal testing and bug fixing
   - Deploy to TestFlight for beta testing
   - Prepare for App Store submission and production deployment

## Technical Stack

### Backend

- **API Server**: Node.js with Express or NestJS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Push Notifications**: Custom APNs implementation
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with Microsoft OAuth integration
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose

### iOS App

- **Framework**: Swift with SwiftUI
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Networking**: Combine framework with URLSession
- **Local Storage**: Core Data and Keychain
- **Push Notifications**: UNUserNotificationCenter and APNs
- **Authentication**: ASWebAuthenticationSession for OAuth

## Getting Started

To begin implementing the iOS companion app and multi-tenant containerization:

1. Review the [iOS Companion App Plan](ios-companion-app-plan.md) for a high-level overview
2. Examine the [iOS App Technical Specification](ios-app-technical-spec.md) for detailed requirements
3. Use the [iOS App Structure](ios-app-structure.md) as a template for the iOS app implementation
4. Follow the [Multi-Tenant Containerization](multi-tenant-containerization.md) guide for setting up the containerized backend

## Prerequisites

- Apple Developer Program membership for iOS app distribution and APNs
- Microsoft Azure account for OAuth integration
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
- Node.js development environment for backend services
- Xcode and Swift development environment for iOS app

## Next Steps

After reviewing this documentation:

1. Set up the development environment for both backend and iOS development
2. Begin implementing the backend API server with multi-tenancy support
3. Create the iOS app project structure following the provided template
4. Implement the containerization approach for testing and deployment
