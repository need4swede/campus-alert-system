- This is a React application built with Vite, using TypeScript and Docker for containerization.

- The application has two modes: development and production.

- The application can be run in two ways:

  - Using npm scripts for local development
  - Using Docker for both development and production environments

- For local development with npm:

  - The command `npm run dev` will start the Vite development server on port 8181 (as specified in vite.config.ts)
  - The command `npm run build` will build the application for production
  - The command `npm run build:dev` will build the application for development
  - The command `npm run preview` will preview the built application

- For Docker:

  - There are two Docker Compose files:

    - `docker-compose.build.yml`: For building the image locally
    - `docker-compose.yml`: For pulling the pre-built image from 'need4swede/react'

  - The application can be run in development or production mode by setting the `BUILD_MODE` environment variable
